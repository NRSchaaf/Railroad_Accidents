# Forecasting Railroad Track Failures Due to Extreme Temperature Flucuations

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that helps to predict potential derailment locations specifically caused by track failures due to the result of extreme temperatures fluctuations. By integrating national weather forecasts with historical derailment and track data, the model will identify high-risk areas where derailments are most likely to occur based off the weather forecast. This analysis aims to enable predictive maintenance strategies, focusing on increasing track inspections and repairs during and immediately after periods of extreme weather conditions to mitigate derailment risks.

<br />
Track failures are the leading cause of non-reportable derailments and over 12,000 reportable events recorded, according to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). As climate change contributes to increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather patterns, the risk of derailments due to wide gauge is likely to rise. This project is significant because it will provide a data-driven approach to mitigating these risks. By predicting where derailments are likely to occur, rail companies can proactively focus maintenance and inspection efforts, reducing the likelihood of accidents, protecting human lives, and preserving infrastructure.
